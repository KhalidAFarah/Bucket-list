            <h1>What is global warming? </h1>
            <br>
            <p>These effects are expected to intensify over the next few decades. Today both the ocean and forest around are filled with plastic and human waste. The problem is that we for years have been throwing away resources that we didn’t use. Our society is consumer based unknowingly using more resources than the planet can keep up with as well ruining the habitable earth for animals. If this behaviour keeps up, in the future the global.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The effects of global warming will have a distinct effect on the livelihood of this generation and the next ones to come. It is curial that we take action to protect the very place we call home. The fight against global warming must not only be initiated by governments and companies, but also by us individuals.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is a non-disputive fact that climate change has had devastating consequences on eco-systems, animal wildlife and marine life. Climate change affects all regions of the world, and it is expected to rapidly intensify over the next few decades. Human activity plays a pivotal role for climate change. The countless choices we make on a daily basis can play a curcial role in the expansion/or reduction of our carbon footprint.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Global warming has a huge impact on our societies, our ecosystems, the economy and even our health. From the destructions of ecosystems across the globe to the catastriphic storms affecting millions of people on a daily basis – these are just some examples to show just how important this issue is. By reducing our energy consumption, we can reduce our carbon footprint while also putting in less money in expensive energy. (siste setning om det at vi er sterkere sammen)</p>
            <br>
            <p>It can seem hard to know where to begin in the quest for an eco-friendly lifestyle. There exists a myriad of different choices one could make to reduce our carbon footprint. We wanted our solution to revolve around three main points: accessibility for all, effectiveness and universal design. Our common enemy is the greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, we wanted to build our solution on one core idea: Minimizing the greenhouse gas emissions from carbon dioxide.</p>
