            </header>
            <p>Have you ever asked yourself how you could make an impact on the world? Imagine having the opportunity to direct positive influence on the local community by doing small, but notable actions on a weekly basis. Currently, more and more people has become aware of the negative effects littering has on the planet – both on a local and global level.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It can be hard to know how one can contribute to the green movement. There exists a myriad of different eco-friendly actions that could be implemented in one’s daily routine. Where does one begin? Is there a way to make it easier and fun for the local community to participate in picking up trash for the sake of our environment?</p>
            <br>
            <p>We want this to become a communal habit – a movement revolving around the contentment of helping the local community become cleaner and safer place for everybody. Many of us tend to become passive about these types of issues because we do not feel like our contributions doesn’t matter. This can result in diffusion of responsibility, because we believe that other people will do the job. We therefore want to have the whole community as our target group. It is important for us to break the idea that we as individuals cannot do extraordinary things.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our problem is visible on media outlets all over the world. It is a known fact that climate change is a real and urgent threat. The problem is how we as individuals can help contribute to an eco-friendlier environment. One often must search through multiple articles and use a lot of time trying to find information about this problem. This time-consuming process ends up becoming demotivating and boring.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our app promotes inclusion and socialization because these are keys to make significant changes in our local environment. Seeing as people have different levels of competence, it is vital for us that our app targets everyone. We have people who have knowledge of recycling but lack the motivation to do the task. Then there are those that doesn’t possess that knowledge. We also have people who frankly do not care about the environment. This application needed to become a common ground for everyone in our communities.</p>
