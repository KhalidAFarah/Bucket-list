                <h1>Løsningen</h1>
            </header>
            <p>GreenRoutine is both an app and machine that works towards giving people a purpose as to why they should recycle. Our idea works in a simple way, the more you recycle into the machines, the more points you get. The points can later be used in the app toward getting discounts and prizes. GreenRoutine is the solution towards making more and more people be actively engaged in recycling garbage.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>How does the app work?</h2>
            <p>When you first login to the app, you get a menu that has your own QR-code which is used to start the machine, in other words, the app and the machine are linked. The app has an overview of the points list and the number of points you have collected from recycling. You have a statistic of how much of the different types of junk you've thrown weekly, and level challenges so you can level up and earn more points. In addition, you have a coupon category where you can see what kind of offers you get, depending on the time.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>How does the machine work?</h2>
            <p>Once the QR-code on the app is scanned on the screen of the machine, the machine will then open the door where the user can recycle his garbage. The garbage to be thrown should be thrown into bags: blue plastic waste bags, green food waste bags and other colored bags for waste. The machine has a color sensor that looks at the color of the bag to be recycled by the user. The machine is also connected to three different garbage cans, each of which represents the three options to which the garbage can be recycled. The fact that the machine has a color sensor enables the machine to recycle the garbage bag to the correct waste well depending on which color bag is recycled by the user. When the user recycles his garbage, the machine takes it easy and checks what color the bag has, and then send it down into the machine where the weight is measured in grams. The weighting results in a certain amount of points that can be used on coupons etc.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When the user scans the QR-code on the screen of the machine it will verbally and with text tell that the QR-code is either valid or not. The screen will also either show a red color or a green color indicating whenever the QR-code was valid. is scanned on the screen of the machine, the machine will then open the door where the user can recycle his garbage.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The screen on the machine also gives instructions with both animations with verbal explanation and text on how and what the user can recycle. The verbal explanation can be turned off if the user chooses to. The animation length runs for about 1min and repeats the process until 5min have passed then the machine will automatically shut down and close the hatched. The user can also choose to close the machine manually by scanning their QR-code again.</p>
            <br>
